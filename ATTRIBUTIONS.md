# Attributions
This project wouldn't be possible without the amazing libraries included in it such as [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) and [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader)

## TinyColor
TinyColor is a small, fast library for color manipulation and conversion in JavaScript. It allows many forms of input, while providing color conversions and other color utility functions. It has no dependencies.

## Web Font Loader
Web Font Loader gives you added control when using linked fonts via @font-face. It provides a common interface to loading fonts regardless of the source, then adds a standard set of events you may use to control the loading experience. The Web Font Loader is able to load fonts from Google Fonts, Typekit, Fonts.com, and Fontdeck, as well as self-hosted web fonts. It is co-developed by Google and Typekit. 

> Currently only Google Fonts is supported in libThemer
